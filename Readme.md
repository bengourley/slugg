# Slugg

Make strings url-safe.

- Comprehensive tests
- No dependencies
- Not in coffee-script (lol)
- Coerces foreign symbols to their english equivalent
- Doesn't try to do anything fancy with symbols (just removes them)
- Works in browser (`window.slugg`) and AMD/CommonJS-flavoured module loaders

```
npm install slugg
```

## Usage:

### slug(string, [separator], [toStrip], [preserveCase])

```js
var slug = require('slugg')

slug('My fantastic blog post')
//-> 'my-fantastic-blog-post'

slug('Today I found £5')
//-> 'today-i-found-5'

slug('I ♥ you')
//-> 'i-you'
```

If you want a separator other than '-', pass it in as the second argument:

```js
slug('Kevin Spacey', ' ')
//-> 'kevin spacey'
```

If you want to strip some characters rather than replace them with a separator, pass
a regex as the last option that will match the chars you want to replace, eg:

```js
slug('Mum\'s cooking', /'/g)
//-> 'mums-cooking'
```
Remember to use the `g` flag if you want all the matches stripped (not just the first).

```js
slug('Mums cooking', undefined, undefined, true)
//-> 'Mums-cooking'
```

With the preserveCase option, you can allow uppercase characters
as well in the output.
